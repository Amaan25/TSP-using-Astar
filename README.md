# TSP-using-Astar
A C++ program to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem by an approximation algorithm A star, using Minimum Spanning Tree heuristics.

random_matrix.cpp: a program that creates a matrix of specified size having values in a specified range and stores it in the input.txt file
TSP_using_MST.cpp: gives an approximate solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem and prints the output in the output.txt file

Note: create input.txt and output.txt files in the same directory
